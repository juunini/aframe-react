/**
 * The raycaster component provides line-based intersection testing with a [raycaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting). Raycasting is the method of extending a line from an origin towards a direction, and checking whether that line intersects with other entities.
 *
 * The raycaster component uses the [three.js raycaster](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/core/Raycaster). The raycaster checks for intersections at a certain interval against a list of objects, and will emit events on the entity when it detects intersections or clearing of intersections (i.e., when the raycaster is no longer intersecting an entity).
 *
 * We prescribe that the set of objects that the raycaster tests
 * for intersection is explicitly defined via the objects selector property described below.
 * Raycasting is an expensive operation, and we should raycast against
 * only targets that need to be interactable at any given time.
 *
 * The [cursor component](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/components/cursor.html) and [laser-controls components](https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/components/laser-controls.html) both build on top of the raycaster component.

 * @see https://aframe.io/docs/1.2.0/components/raycaster.html
